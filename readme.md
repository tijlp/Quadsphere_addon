# Quadsphere Addon

Really simple Blender addon to make a cube into a sphere with all quad topology.
Adds the item to the shift+A menu so you can use it like any mesh primitive.

Subdivision are needed to give the cube enough topo to deform.
Then all you need is a cast modifier set to factor 1  

I usually do this with hardOps/spherecast but it's an extra step,
and this shape should really be inside Blender by default.
Extra objects addon adds a "round cube" but it's not the same thing...
