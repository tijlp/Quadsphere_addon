# Quadsphere Addon

Really simple Blender addon to make a cube into a sphere, that has quad topology.
Adds a quadsphere to the shift+A menu so you can add it like any mesh primitive.

Subdivision are needed to give the cube enough topo to deform.
Then all you need is a cast modifier set to factor 1  

I usually do this with hardOps/spherecast but it's an extra step.
Extra objects addon adds a "round cube" but it's not the same thing...
